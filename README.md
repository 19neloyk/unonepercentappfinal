Funding Application Scoring App for UN One Percent for Development Fund

###### The UN One Percent for Development for Staff Fund receives applications from all over the world asking for the sponsoring of self-sustaining community projects in typically poor communities. 

###### A small group of people within the Fund are tasked with reading each individual application and deciding if a given project is worthy of the entire Fund's consideration. This is an extremely time-consuming process and one that can be aided through the use of modern-day computing. This is what my app serves to accomplish. 


**Here's how my program works:**

Usually applicants answer a set of questions on the Fund's website and respond through email, which the group of people within the fund read. However, I made a form (in 3 languages to accompany the majority of the non-English speaking responders). The form's answers, which represent an application, go to a server, which scans the application, and assigns the application a score based on certain characteristics such as location, religious affiliation(which the Fund does not want to associate with), cost of project, and if the project requires giving out salaries. Then, the applications get transferred, as an array, to a website, which ranks the applications based on their scores (in descending order). The group of people usually reading the email applications would have a link to this page and, instead, look at each application ranked by score, with a mention of the faults within each application provided near the applications.
